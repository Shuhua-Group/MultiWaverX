# MultiWaverX
MultiWaver series software was designed to infer population admixture history in case of various and complex scenarios. The earlier versions of MultiWaver considered only autosomal admixture events. Here, we developed a updated version MultiWaverX to model the detailed sex-biased admixture events in case of the continuous and discrete gene flow.
Functions of MultWaver 2.0 were also implemented in this new version, which can be invoked with specific parameters.

The usages of MultiWaverX can be found in MultiWaverX_manual.pdf
